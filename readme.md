## User churn prediction ##
In this [notebook], I demonstrate how to use tree-ensemble methods to predict user churn  from telecom usage data. The dataset consists of 5000 data with 21 features. I primarily used the **pandas** to process data, and **sklearn** to build machine learning models. When choosing the models, I first experimented the logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and boosing models. I found that tree-based models perform better (higher F1 score and computationally faster) even without fine tuning hyper-parameters. After fine-tuning the gradient boosting model, I improved the F1 score from 0.71 to 0.74, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.96. I also identified the top 3 most important features, which are **total day charge**, **number of customer service calls** and **total evening minutes**. Finally, I plotted the ROC curve, and calculated the AUC to be 0.92 for the best model.
